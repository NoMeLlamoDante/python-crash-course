in the book of python crash course, i've learning to make programs 
use variables, arithmetic operations with there, define functions, 
the diferences between arguments and parameters, boolean operations 
diferent ways to solve problems using loops, store information in 
dictionaries, lists and tuples, when use them and why. 
Now i'm learning about classes, how code them, methods and inheritance, 
make imports form clases and other types of archives.
